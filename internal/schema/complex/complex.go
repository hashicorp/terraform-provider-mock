	description = `A complex resource that contains five basic attributes, four complex attributes, and two nested blocks.

The five basic attributes are boolean, number, string, float, and integer (as with the tfcoremock_simple_resource).

The complex attributes are a map, a list, a set, and an object. The object type contains the same set of attributes as the schema itself, making a recursive structure. The list, set and map all contain objects which are also recursive. Blocks cannot go into attributes, so the complex attributes do not recurse on the block types.

The blocks are a nested list and a nested set. The blocks contain the same set of attributes and blocks as the schema itself, also making a recursive structure. Note, blocks contain both attributes and more blocks so the block types are fully recursive.

The complex and block types are nested %d times, at the leaf level of recursion the complex attributes and blocks only contain the simple (ie. non-recursive) attributes. This prevents a potentially infinite level of recursion.`
